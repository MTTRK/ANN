# College Project about Artifical Neural Networks

## WarmUp
This project contains some exercises that help to embrace the theory of ANN-s, especially RNN-s.
Also the use of 3rd party libraries like Keras will appear in the code.

## MorphemeSegmentation
Morphological segmentation, which aims to break words into meaning-bearing morphemes, is an important task in natural language processing.
Here we are going to concern ourselves with the hungarian language (a challenging task).
